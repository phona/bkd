/**
 * Order 90 — Timeline conversion stage.
 *
 * Runs each NormalizedLogEntry through the per-issue stateful TimelineConverter
 * exactly once (regardless of how many SSE clients are connected) and re-emits
 * the produced TimelineEntries on the `timeline-entry` channel.
 *
 * Why a pipeline stage and not the SSE handler?
 *   The SSE handler runs per-connection. If conversion happened there,
 *   N connected clients would advance the converter's internal state N times
 *   per log entry — sequence numbers would inflate, segment counters would
 *   drift, and clients would diverge.
 *
 * Streaming and visibility gates moved here so this stage matches the SSE
 * subscriber's input filter: SSE simply forwards `timeline-entry` events.
